# Boundary Gym

**Assertiveness under pressure.**

Boundary Gym is a training app that helps people practice holding clear boundaries when someone pushes back.

Most assertiveness advice assumes cooperation.  
Real conversations don’t.

This app uses realistic roleplay, escalation, and post-session clinical audits to train one skill: staying calm, direct, and consistent under pressure.

## What This App Does

- Simulates high-friction conversations (e.g. a pushy boss)
- Applies realistic pushback using guilt, urgency, and minimization
- Escalates pressure when the user over-explains or defends
- Ends only when the user holds a firm boundary
- Generates a clinical audit after each round

The audit identifies:
- Where the user justified, argued, defended, or explained (JADE)
- Tone stability under pressure
- Manipulation tactics applied
- A shorter, stronger “power phrase” upgrade

---

## What This App Is Not

Boundary Gym is not:
- Therapy
- Emotional processing
- Conflict resolution training
- Motivation or reassurance
- A communication style quiz

It does not teach persuasion or niceness.

It trains assertiveness as a behavioral skill.

## Core Principles

- Neutral tone over emotional validation  
- Precision over encouragement  
- Practice over advice  
- Realism over comfort  

If the experience feels slightly uncomfortable, it’s working.
